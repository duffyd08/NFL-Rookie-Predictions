# NFL-Rookie-Predictions

Our group set out to look into predicting wether offensive skill players in the NFL will sign another contract with their draft team. We used data from nflfastR and used a binary classification model to predict "yes" or "no" based on game statisitcs for years after they were drafted. Our group focused on linear regression and random forest to conduct a lot of our research. Check out the slide presentation!
